  <h1>ABOUT NICK SMALLMAN</h1>
  <p>Nick is the Founder and CEO of boutique training 
    company Working Voices. Over the last 20 years he’s developed more than 50 Courses,
     Workshops and Seminars in all areas of human communication. He has lectured at the London
      Business School and Columbia Business School and counts some of the world’s most successful 
 companies as his clients, such as JPMorgan, Sony Music, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock.<br><br>Nick’s
  political work is focused primarily in the UK and US where he works with politicians on everything 
  from campaigns to communication strategy. Building political brands and crafting powerful speeches 
  that get results are the lifeblood of his work, but he often provides an objective ear for his 
  clients who are trying to solve a problem connected with their influence.<br><br> Nick is particularly 
  interested in the effect of smartphones and social media on society. As our culture becomes
   increasingly screen based, our relationship with technology is fast becoming the dominant
    communication issue of our age. Nick lectures on this subject and works with young people and 
    businesses, helping them to have a healthier online experience. He operates a website called your
    lifeonsocialmedia.com to help people to change their relationship with social media via workshops.<br><br> 
    Nick is also the Co-Founder and advisor to Curv, a new social network that looks to put collaboration
     at the heart of our online experience.<br> <br>When coaching, Nick is inspirational and insightful. He 
     believes in showing rather than telling and his style is conversational, challenging, and
      improvisational.<br><br> Perhaps unsurprisingly, Nick is often called upon to comment on current events 
      in both the business and political spheres. He also works with charities and non-profit organisations.
       He enjoys mentoring young entrepreneurs and coaching people who 
    wish to be in politics.<br><br> He lives in London</p>
